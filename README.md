# Fly-Trap

I'd like to present you my project which is small RPG game with isometric view and 8-bit graphics style.

# Main goals

- Short story and few quests introducing us to our world
- Items and equipment to wear and maybe change our stats (adding health or attack strength
- Make 2/3 different classes for our character
- Working Main Menu
- Enemies and fight in real time
- All graphics and sounds will be made by me
